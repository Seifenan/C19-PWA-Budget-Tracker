  ## Usage 
  User must visit my deployed application and use it as an expense tracker. Users are able to add and remove transaction amounts in order to be mindful of their current expenses and overall budget. Users are able to use this application regardless of their internet connection. If the user's device loses connectivity, the app will maintain the required information cached and upload it once the device regains a connection.
